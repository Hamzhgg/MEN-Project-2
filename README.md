# Smoked & Grilled

Project Idea Concept:
 “Best Smoked and Grilled Meat Restaurants” is an interactive web app designed to make it easy to discover top places offering delightful experiences for smoked and grilled meat lovers. The app combines a guide with reviews to provide comprehensive information on a curated selection of restaurants specializing in this cuisine. Users can view details such as location, opening hours, prices, and customer ratings. Additionally, they can filter options based on preferences like meat type or budget and explore restaurant locations effortlessly with an interactive map.
This project aims to help users find unique dining experiences for smoked and grilled meats, making the search process more convenient and personalized.
